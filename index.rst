Welcome to the ClimateStudio User Guide
===================================================
ClimateStudio is an advanced daylighting, electric lighting, and thermal simulation software developed by `Solemma LLC`_. It supports a series of environmental analysis workflows for buildings and neighborhoods including annual illuminance simulations, glare and thermal comfort distributions in daylit and artificially lit spaces, as well as annual and seasonal radiation map analysis for urban massing and shading design studies. The software also offers eligibiltiy checks for daylight and view credits in the LEED, EN 17037, and BREEAM certification systems.
	
ClimateStudio is a plugin for the `Rhinoceros (Rhino)`_ 3d modeling software developed and distributed by Robert McNeel & Associates. An installed version of Rhino 6, 7, or 8 with a valid license is required to run ClimateStudio.
	
The Getting Started section provides a quick overview of the ClimateStudio interface. The following sections explore the individual features and analysis workflows.
