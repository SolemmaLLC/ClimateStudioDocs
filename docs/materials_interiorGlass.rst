Interior Glass
================================================

Interior glass assemblies are monolithic glazing units without dynamic shading. 

Please note that in the 3D Rhino model, **glazing units must be modeled as single surfaces**. They should not include multiple surfaces (e.g. multiple glass panes), and they should not contain any solids. 

ClimateStudio provides a collection of units sourced from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory's (LBNL's) `International Glazing Database`_ (IGDB). Click on a row in the table to change the selection.
