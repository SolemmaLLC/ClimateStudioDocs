Interior Glass
================================================

Interior glazing assemblies are monolithic glazing units without dynamic shading. 

Please note that in the 3D Rhino model, **glazing units must be modeled as single surfaces**. They should not include multiple surfaces (e.g. multiple glass panes), and they should not contain any solids. 

ClimateStudio provides a collection of units sourced from the International Glazing Database (IGDB). Click on a row in the table to change the selection.
