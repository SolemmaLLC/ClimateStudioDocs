Learning ClimateStudio
================================================
To get started using ClimateStudio we recommend that to watch a few of the video tutorials for ClimateStudio on the `Solemma web site.`_ We recommend that you start with  3 minute the `Interface Overview`_ and then dive into any Climate Studioâ€™s design analysis workflows:

.. _Solemma web site.: https://solemma.com/TrainingClimateStudio.html

.. _Interface Overview: https://vimeo.com/392379382

- `Site Analysis`_ 
- `Radiation Map`_
- `Point-in-time Illuminance`_
- `Daylight Availability`_
- `Annual Glare`_
- `Radiance Render`_
- `Thermal Model`_ 

.. _Site Analysis: siteAnalysis.html 

.. _Radiation Map: radiationMap.html 

.. _Point-in-time Illuminance: point-in-timeIlluminance.html

.. _Daylight Availability: daylightAvailability.html 

.. _Annual Glare: annualGlare.html

.. _Radiance Render: radianceRender.html

.. _Thermal Model: thermalModel.html

To get to any of these workflows open Rhino, search for the ClimateStudio toolbar  and select a workflow.

As a result the CS workflow panel will open up. The panel is a dock-able Rhino element meaning that you can drag and drop to set up your Rhino workspace. You can switch between workflow via the ClimateStudio toolbar or by using the top pull-down menu in the CS workflow panel.

As a side note, if you are unfamiliar with computer aided design (CAD) software in general or Rhino in particular, you might want to also go through various online material such as the `Lynda tutorials for Rhino.`_ 

If you are interested in learning more about the theory underlying the different ClimateStudio workflows, some of the material provided bel ow might be useful:

- `MIT open courseware`_ for 4.401/4/464 Environmental Technologies in Buildings (lecture notes from MIT)
- EdX course on `Sustainable Building Design`_ (free course that runs about twice a year)
- `Daylighting Handbooks`_ (designer-friendly textbooks for students and practitioners)
