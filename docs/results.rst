The results panel is activated once a simulation is in progress (finished its first pass) or complete. The top part of the results panel shows previously run ClimateStudio simulations for the current project in a table. ClimateStudio saves all simulation results in a sub directory located in the same directory as the Rhino file called ``Rhino file name - CS.`` Results can be loaded or unloaded from the Results panel overview table. When a result is selected (by left-clicking on it), it is displayed in the lower part of the results panel as well as the Rhino viewport, if applicable. 

`Result comparison`_ graphs can be created by clicking the colored bar chart icon. 

Results Organization
-------------------------
Results should be named according to their main design feature such as the glazing type, if that has been modified. While results are stored in a binary format, their content can be exported in CSV or other formats.
