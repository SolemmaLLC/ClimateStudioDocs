The results panel is activated once a simulation is in progress (finished its first pass) or complete. The top part of the results panel shows previously run CLimateStudio simulations for the current project in a table. ClimatteStudio saves all simulation results in a sub directory located the same directory as the Rhino file called ``Rhino file name - CS.`` Results can be loaded or unloaded from the Results panel overview table. When a result is selected (by left-clicking on it) it is displayed in the lower part of the results panel as well as the Rhino viewport, if applicable. 

Results Organization
-------------------------
Results should be named according to their main design feature such as the glazing typs if that has been modified. While results are stored in binary format their content can be exported in CSV or other formats.
