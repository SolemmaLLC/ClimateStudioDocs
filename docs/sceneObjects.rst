As of v2.0 there are three different scene assets that can be placed: 

| 1 - `Luminaires`_ (optional)
| 2 - `Tubular Daylighting Devices`_ (optional)
| 3 - `Trees`_ (optional)

`Luminaires`_ are available for the following workflows: 

- `Point-in-time Illuminance`_
- `Radiance Render`_

`Tubular Daylighting Devices`_ are available for the following workflows: 

- `Point-in-time Illuminance`_
- `Daylight Availability`_
- `Annual Glare`_
- `Radiance Render`_

`Trees`_ are available for the following workflows: 

- `Point-in-time Illuminance`_
- `Daylight Availability`_
- `Annual Glare`_
- `Radiance Render`_
- `Radiation Map`_
- `View Analysis`_
