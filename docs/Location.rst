Location
================================================
The location subpanel is used to specify the position of the site on earth by selecting the closest available typical meteorological year (TMY). 
A TMY file contains hourly measured data for a variety of physical quantities that are required for an environmental performance analysis 
including direct and diffuse solar radiation, temperature and relative humidity levels as well as wind speed and direction. The default site 
is the TMY3 file for Boston, Logan International Airport. To select another file, left-click on the file selector icon next to the name of the current TMY file.
