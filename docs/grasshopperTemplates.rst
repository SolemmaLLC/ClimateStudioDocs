Grasshopper Workflow Templates
=================================
Most ClimateStudio workflows can be run via the Graphical User Interface in Rhino as well as using Rhino’s algorithmic modeling environment Grasshopper. In case you are not already familiar with Grasshopper, please refer to the `McNeel website`_. Otherwise, try out one of our many GH workflow templates. 

To get started, type “grasshopper” in the Rhino command prompt and load the CS Workflow Templates component (see below). Follow the instructions provided on the Grasshopper canvas. In most instances you just have to press “run”.
