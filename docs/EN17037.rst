EN 17037
================================================
EN 17037 is a unified daylighting standard published by the European Committee for Standardization (`CEN`_) in 2018 (CEN 17037:2018). It covers four aspects of daylight in buildings, including daylight provision, views, access to sunlight, and prevention of glare. As of version 1.5, ClimateStudio supports compliance calculations for the the first of these: daylight provision.
