Requirements
================================================
ClimateStudio is a plugin for the Rhinoceros 3D NURBS modeler. To use ClimateStudio, you will need the following:

Hardware
	1. A newer computer with Windows OS installed on it. ClimateStudio does currently not run under Mac OS. If you have a Mac you will need to install a multi boot utility such as `boot camp.`_ 

	2. Although not strictly required, a modern graphics card that supports OpenCL and/or CUDA is highly recommended.

Software
	1. You need the latest version of `Rhinoceros 3D version 6.`_  A free, fully functional 90 day evaluation version is available from the McNeel web site.

	2. If you intend to use ClimateStudio for commercial purposes, you need to `request`_ a ClimateStudio Trial from Solemma. If you are an educator or student, find out whether your school already has a `ClimateStudio ambassador`_.
