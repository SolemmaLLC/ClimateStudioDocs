Requirements
================================================
ClimateStudio is a plugin for the `Rhinoceros 3D NURBS modeler`_.
To use ClimateStudio, you need the following:

Hardware
	1. A computer running the Windows operating system. ClimateStudio does not currently run on the Mac operating system. Mac users can still use ClimateStudio by running Windows through a multi-boot utility such as `boot camp`_. 

	2. A modern graphics card that supports OpenCL and/or CUDA is highly recommended.

Software
	1. The latest version of `Rhino 6 or 7`_.  A free, fully functional 90 day trial is available from the McNeel web site.

	2. A license for ClimateStudio. An installer and trial license for commercial purposes can be `requested here`_. Teachers and students can obtain an academic license through their school's participation in Solemma's free `educational licensing program`_.

Knowledge
	If you are unfamiliar with computer aided design (CAD) software in general or Rhino in particular, you can find `tutorials on the web`_ or online training such as the `Lynda tutorials for Rhino`_.

	For more information about the underlying theory behind the ClimateStudio workflows, check out these sources:

- `MIT open courseware`_ for 4.401/4.464 Environmental Technologies in Buildings (lecture notes from MIT)
- EdX course on `Sustainable Building Design`_ (free course that runs about twice a year)
- `Daylighting Handbooks`_ (designer-friendly textbooks for students and practitioners)
