================================================
ClimateStudio is a plugin for the `Rhinoceros 3D NURBS modeler`_.
To use ClimateStudio, you need the following:

	2. A modern graphics card that supports OpenCL and/or CUDA is highly recommended.

Software
	1. The latest version of `Rhino 6 or 7`_.  A free, fully functional 90 day trial is available from the McNeel web site.
