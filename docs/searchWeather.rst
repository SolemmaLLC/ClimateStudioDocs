The drop-down menu next to the search bar filters for the `type of weather data`_. By default, it is set to only display TMYx.2004-2018 data as those are the most up-to-date and should be used for most analysis. 
More options are available by expanding the drop-down.

The search will try to match every sub-string separated by space. The search is always case insensitive. It searches across both the **Location**, **Country**, and **Data Type** fields.

If a file is available locally, the **Source** column will display "LocalFile". Else it will require an internet connection to access that weather data. 

Once a weather file is selected, click the "OK" or "Download" button to either load the file if it was already downloaded as a local file or download and load it from the respective source.
