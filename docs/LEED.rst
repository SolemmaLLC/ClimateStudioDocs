LEED
================================================
Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (`LEED`_) is a green building rating system maintained by the US Green Building Council (`USGBC`_). ClimateStudio supports the calculation of LEED v4 Daylight and Quality Views credits. Both modules support one-click generation of PDF reports, which can be submitted directly to USGBC in lieu of filling out the online Daylight and Quality Views Calculator.
