BREEAM
================================================
BREEAM is a UK-based green building rating system maintained by the Building Research Establishment Group (`BRE`_). ClimateStudio supports the calculation of BREEAM credits for the achievement of good-practice daylighting levels. To calculate the credit, use the Daylight Availability workflow and select the appropriate BREEAM sub-workflow. The 4a and 4c options establish daylight levels using daylight factor, whereas the 4b options use annual illuminance statistics. For detailed instructions on setting up a simulation and interpreting results, follow the links below:
