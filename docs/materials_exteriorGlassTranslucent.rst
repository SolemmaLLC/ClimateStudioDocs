Exterior Glass (Translucent Insulating)
================================================

Translucent insulating glazing units are facade products with both light diffusing and heat insulating properties.

Please note that in the 3D Rhino model, **glazing units must be modeled as single surfaces**. They should not include multiple surfaces (e.g. multiple glass panes), and they should not contain any solids.
