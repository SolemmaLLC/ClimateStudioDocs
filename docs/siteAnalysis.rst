This workflow supports direct shading studies, i.e. an evaluation of how a given scene geometry interacts with direct sunlight over the course of the year. This information may be used for multiple purposes such as to determine when in the year a give site or building is shaded by neighboring objects, how to size an overhang or where to place solar cells or collectors. 

The workflow relies on two input subpanels, location and the sun path.

- Go to the `Location Subpanel`_
- Go to the `Sun Path Subpanel`_
