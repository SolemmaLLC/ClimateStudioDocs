This workflow supports several types of site and climate analysis, including sun path and wind diagrams, shadow studies, psychrometric charts, and hourly/diurnal plots of weather data. The workflow relies on two subpanels:

- `Location`_
- `Climate Charts`_

.. _Location: Location.html

.. _Climate Charts: climateCharts.html
