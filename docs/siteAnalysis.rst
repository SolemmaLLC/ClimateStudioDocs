This workflow supports direct shading studies, i.e. an evaluation of how a given scene geometry interacts with direct sunlight over the course of the year. 
This information may be used for multiple purposes such as to determine when in the year a given site or building is shaded by neighboring objects, 
how to size an overhang or where to place photovoltaic cells or solar hot water collectors. The workflow relies on two input subpanels:

- `Location`_
- `Climate Charts`_
