EnergyPlus Simulation Settings
================================================
This dialogue allows the user to set the start and end date of a simulation, as well as the time step at which the simulation results are being reported. EnergyPlus simulations are by default set to 4 times per hour (every 15 minutes). Results are usually saved at a one hour time steps and run through the whole calendar year. Changing these default settings causes the simulation results to not be displayed properly in the results panel.
